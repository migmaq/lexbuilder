* Hackathon mode
- this is all a bit wonky - still in hackathon mode!

* Python 3
- is assumed that your "python" command runs python 3
- if not, on ubuntu you can "apt install python-is-python3" to achieve this
  (maybe not still required on latest version ???)

* Install MongoDb Server.
- I am using the version from the mongo website:
  https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
- The ubuntu package manager version may be quite stale (mongo switched
  from AGPL to SSPL some time ago, so not sure if ubuntu stopped at the last
  AGPL version).

* Install the pymongo package
- I should do a setup.py, virtualenv thing but for now:
  $ python -m pip install pymongo

* Start mongodb
$ ./mmodb.sh
- will create the db in a subdir called "mmodb" if it does not already
  exist.
- this is running on a non-standard port (so as not to collide with a
  possible OS install of mongodb)
- long term this will be switched to run under systemd - this method is
  just for development.

* Download "legacy-mmo.json"
- I didn't put in the git repository because is will bloat it, so
  grab it with wget thusly:
$ cd lexbuilder/import-data
$ wget entropy.org/legacy-mmo.json

* Run the importer
$ python import_from_legacy_mmo.py
- Last line will be something like "DB now has 6739 records"
- Each run nukes the DB and reloads.

* Do the codegen
$ python compile_models.py
- long term this step will be integrated or not required
- for now drops "resources/lexi.html" (the test lexeme editor)
  
* Start mmoserver and visit a page
$ python mmoserver.py
http://localhost:8080/wordlist
http://localhost:8080/resources/lexi.html
