# Dependencies

To make it more likely that Lexbuilder will still run in a few
decades without hassle, we eschew the usual 'depend on everything'
party, use as few dependencies as possible, and include them fully in
this directory.

Lexbuilder should be able to run with no external dependencies other
than the Python Standard Library.

# bottle.py

"Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for
Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no
dependencies other than the Python Standard Library."
