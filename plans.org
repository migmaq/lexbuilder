* Approval process
- plan to have 2 versions of at least the 'entries' collection (mongos
  name for a table) - 'entries' and 'entries_published'.
- when the site is in 'edit' mode, the 'entries' collection will be used.
- when the site is in 'published' mode, the 'entries_published' ...
- direct edits can only be made to the 'entries' collection.
- there will be queries that show all 'entries' that are newer than
  the corresponding published version, and a way of doing the approval,
  which will copy it over.
- this would be a total mess with a relational DB (db integrity when
  complicated things are modelled using relations), but we almost
  never use joins in mongo - each entry stands alone - so works OK.
** Complications
- changes to Smith-Francis fields will need SF approval
- changes to Listuguj fields will need Listuguj
- what about changes to just the english parts?
- how to communicate requests for more changes?
- they currently require approval from multiple people, either
  have to build this in, or have this out of band - which will
  be harder for Smith Francis (Lisuguj is done by a small group that
  meet in person)
